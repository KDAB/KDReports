KD Reports requires Qt 4.6 or later

If you are using sources from github (via a git clone or a generated zip file), jump
to section 1-bis). Commercial users, start at section 1).

1) From the top directory of your KD Reports installation
 run the "configure" scripts.

   On Windows use depending on the kind of build one of the following;
     configure.bat -shared -debug
     configure.bat -shared -release

   On Unix use depending on the kind of build one of the following;
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug
     ./configure.sh -shared -release

   To define the install-location use for example;
     configure.bat -shared -debug -prefix c:/kdreports
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug -prefix /opt/kdreports

1-bis) If you are building KD Reports from a github clone rather than a release tarball,
the configure.bat/configure.sh script doesn't exist (it's generated at release time),
you need to do this instead:

   First, a working Python (version2) is required and must be found in your
   execute path.  Either a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Python is fine, but run
   python --version to make sure it is found and is python2 before continuing.

   Next, you need to checkout the autogen submodule from the git repository.
   like so:
     git submodule update --init

   And now run autogen.py to create the configure tool.

   On Windows:
     python autogen.py [options]
   On Linux:
     ./autogen.py [options]

Pass the same options to autogen.py as you would for configure.sh/configure.bat
as shown above in step 1).

After running autogen.py, a configure.sh/configure.bat script will exist and
you can use that to re-configure later, as needed.  Then you can continue on
to the platform-specific setup instructions in step 2, 3 or 4.

2) Unix

If you want KDChart support, please set KDCHARTDIR either as an environment variable or on the qmake command line:
export KDCHARTDIR=/path/to/kdchart

set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD Reports installation lib directory.

If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdreports/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The above has to be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course be run from a shell just before building KD Reports, but in this case your settings will only be available for this shell.

If you want to install the libraries under the "lib64" folder then
set the QMAKE_ARGS environment variable to "LIB_SUFFIX=64" like so:
QMAKE_ARGS="LIB_SUFFIX=64"
export QMAKE_ARGS

3) MacOS

Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead
of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4) Windows

If you want KDChart support, please set KDCHARTDIR either as an environment variable or on the qmake command line:
set KDCHARTDIR=C:\path\to\kdchart

Add the path to the KD Reports dll (kdreports\bin) into your PATH environment variable (for running executables)
and the path to the KD Reports lib (kdreports\lib) into your LIB environment variable (for development).

Or run:
set PATH=\path\to\kdreports\bin;%PATH%
set LIB=\path\to\kdreports\lib;%LIB%

5) Compile everything by typing:

make    # Unix,
nmake   # Windows

On Windows you can also use the Qt integration into Visual Studio:
open the toplevel kdreports.pro with "Qt / Open Solution from .pro file".
You still need to adjust the PATH environment variable in order to run the examples.

5) Install headers and libraries by typing:
make install    # Unix
nmake install   # Windows
