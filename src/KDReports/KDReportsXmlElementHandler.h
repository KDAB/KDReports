/**
 * This handler is called for each XML element being parsed
 * from an XML file.
 * It allows you to customize the XML dynamically at runtime,
 * by deriving from the XmlElementHandler interface and reimplementing
 * some or all of the hooks. Each hook (virtual method) is called after the
 * XML element has been parsed into a KDReports element, and before the
 * KDReports element is added to the report. After that, both the XML element
 * and the KDReports element are discarded, which is why this customization
 * has to happen during loading.
 *
 * Example:
 * <code>
 * bool CustomElementHandler::textElement( KDReports::TextElement& textElement, const QDomElement& xmlElement )
 * {
 *     const QString id = xmlElement.attribute( "id" );
 *     if ( id == "customerName" )
 *         textElement.setTextColor( Qt::blue );
 *     return true;
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * All virtual methods return a boolean which can be used to skip an element:
 * if the method returns false, the KDReports element will not be added to the report.
 *
 * Note that you can even insert new elements into the report from any of the
 * handler methods. Those additional elements will be inserted before the currently
 * parsed element.
 *
 * It is possible to signal an error, during parsing, by calling
 * setErrorDetails. This will result in parsing being terminated, and the
 * error being reported to the user.
 *
 * To set up the handler so that it is used during parsing, use
 * <code>
 *   handler = new CustomElementHandler;
 *   report.setXmlElementHandler( handler );
 * </code>
