 *
 * \section intro_sec What is KD Reports?
 *
 *  KD Reports, put simply, is a Qt tool that lets you easily create printable reports by
 *  providing all of the necessary features for a variety of applications.
 *  Reports can be created programmatically, using an easy to use C++ API, or they can be data-driven,
 *  creating reports from XML or SQL data sources complete with watermarks, headers and footers. Reports can be previewed
 *  manually, sent directly to a printer, or saved as
 *  PDF files. Additionally, using <a href="http://www.kdab.com">KDAB's</a> <a href="http://www.kdab.com/?page=products&sub=kdchart">KD Chart</a> package together with KD Reports allows reports
 *  to be garnished with the myriad of chart types supported by <a href="http://www.kdab.com/?page=products&sub=kdchart">KD Chart</a>.
 *
 *  KD Reports targets C++ programmers who use Qt in their
 *  applications. The following reference assumes familiarity with
 *  the C++ programming language and the basic concepts of Qt.
 *
 *  The starting point for using KD Reports is the KDReports::Report class.
