What is new in KD Reports 1.6
===============================

Performance:
---------
* Added KDReports::Report::beginEdit/endEdit. Call beginEdit before adding all your elements
  and endEdit afterwards, so that no relayouting happens while adding the elements, thus
  making report generation on long reports much faster.

Bug fixes:
----------
* AutoTable: format numbers and dates the way QStyledItemDelegate does, using the locale.
  This makes the itemmodels in KDReports look the same way as in a QTableView.
* Resolve partially specified fonts with the report's default font (requires Qt 5.3)
  For instance QFont f; f.setBold(true); will now use the family and size from the report's
  default font, rather than those from the QApplication font.
* KDReports::setDefaultFont now ensures that bitmap fonts aren't used, they are not made
  for text documents / printed reports.
* Fix small memory leak (and reduce memory usage slightly when creating multiple reports)
* Fix compilation on Windows with self-compiled Qt (with no SSL support)

Installation:
----------
* Fix inconsistent installation directory (parts in 1.5.0 and parts in 1.4.99) in 1.5 release.
* Install kdreports.pri file that applications can copy for their own use.
